# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content (e.g., abstract, acknowledgements) here or
# use code similar to line 22-23 for the .RMD files. If you are NOT producing a PDF, you can delete or silence lines 21-32 in this YAML header.

  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00-abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab is 
# needed on the line after the `|`.

#  You can have a dedication here if you wish.

<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

```{r 01setup, include=FALSE}
# Comment this out if we want inline code chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

<!--

Uncomment the following chunk if and when necessary for debugging purposes
-->
```{r, include=FALSE}
options(tinytex.verbose = TRUE)
```


```{r include_packages, include = FALSE}
# This chunk ensures that the thesisdown package is
# installed and loaded. This thesisdown package includes
# the template files for the thesis.

<!-- On ordering the chapter files:
There are two options:
1. Name your chapter files in the order in which you want them to appear (e.g., 01-Inro, 02-Data, 03-Conclusions). 
2. Otherwise, you can specify the order in which they appear in the _bookdown.yml (for PDF only).

Do not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd and 00-abstract.Rmd in the YAML file--they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.
-->

<!-- We can use {.unnumbered} here to make the introduction "Chapter 0." You can also use {-} for no numbers
on chapters.
