Existing research in Chapter \@ref(lit-rev) provided a guide to which data analysis techniques would be effective for achieving the aims of this thesis.
Chapter \@ref(methodology) described these techniques in more detail.
Chapter \@ref(prelimDA) presented results from preliminary data analyses, and noted the implications of these results on forecasting models.
Using these preliminary results, the forecasting models described in Section \@ref(IntroToModels) were fitted to the set of training data (see Section \@ref(trainAndVal)) for each household.
The ability of these models to predict hot water half hour in advance was then tested against the set of validating data.

This chapter presents the results of these predictions, with the performance of each model evaluated against the metrics outlined in Section \@ref(metrics).

## Naive model

As discussed in Section \@ref(naivemeth), we use a simple random walk as a naive model by which to compare the performance of other models to.
When used to predict the next time step, the random walk given in Equation \@ref(eq:randomWalk) becomes $\hat x_{t+1} = x_t$.
<!--
\begin{equation}
\hat x_{t+1} = x_t .
\end{equation}
-->

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "naive/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:randomWalk), we show an example plot of the model's prediction of demand compared to actual demand.
This method is reasonably effective for some houses, in particular those that have long periods where the element power has roughly the same avaraged output. In contrast, households that exhibit frequent oscillation of element power are very poorly modelled by this method, with the predicted values consistently 'missing' the actual values.

The naive model has RMSEs (see Equation \@ref(eq:RMSE)) ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)`W.
During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)`W.
Examination of the daily profile of residuals (see Figure \@ref(fig:naiveResiduals)) shows that this model performs quite poorly during peak periods, with RMSEs during peak periods being `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 0)`% greater than average RMSEs.

The model precisely mimics the actual data with a half-hour lag, and therefore scores highly for physical fidelity. Interpretability is high as this model is represented by a very simple equation, although no illumination as to underlying behavioural properties are actually provided by this model. 
The computational times to fit models to each household were effectively negligible for this model.

## Seasonal naive
<!--
For data that display weekly seasonality, for example that of residential electricity demand, a seasonal naive model would thus predict that hot water demand is the same as it was the same time one week prior. For data at half-hour resolution, one week before the current time step is $48 \times 7 = 336$ time steps prior, thus-->
Similarly to our naive model, the seasonal naive model (see Section \@ref(snaivemeth)) predicts one (half hour) time step onto the future utilising only one prior observation. Where the seasonal naive differs is that it assumes the most likely value for hot water demand will be the value at that same time one period prior.
Based on the results in Section \@ref(ACVresults) that demonstrate daily periodicity, we chose the period length to be one day, thus Equation \@ref(eq:snaive) becomes $\hat x_{t} = x_{t-48}$. 

```{r seasonalNaivePlot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Actual electricity use and seasonal naive model approximation over one day for four households"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "seasonalNaive/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

The results are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:seasonalNaivePlot). 

In general this method is quite ineffective, although in some instances it makes very accurate predictions of the initial instance of the element turning on. 
Contrary to the results in Ref. [@Gelazanskas2015], the seasonal naive model was less accurate than the naive model. 
The reason for this discrepancy may lie in the data itself, with the UK households having more weekly regularity than the NZ households used in this research. Alternatively, this discrepancy may lie in the differences in data resolution or forecast length.
The seasonal naive model has RMSEs ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W. The average RMSE over all households is `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"], 2)`W, corresponding to a `r round((DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"] - DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"])/DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)*100`% decrease in accuracy compared to the naive model.


During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"], 2)`W.
Despite attempting to consider cyclic effects, this model performs very poorly during peak periods. During peak periods, this model shows a percentage error increase (see Equation \@ref(eq:PEI)) of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"], 0)`%, slightly higher than that of the naive model. This is indicated in the daily profile of residuals in Figure \@ref(fig:seasonalNaiveResiduals).

The model precisely mimics the actual data with a week long lag, and therefore scores highly for physical fidelity. Interpretability is high as this model is represented by a very simple equation, although the only illumination this model provides into behavioural properties of hot water use are with respect to how strictly a household follows weekly cycles of demand. The computational time to fit models to each household was negligible for this model.

## Simple linear regression {#SLRres}

<!--
While simple linear regression of univariate data is a useful method of analysing data that has a roughly linear trend, it is generally inadequate when constructed using time series data that displays cyclic behaviour, such as residential electricity demand.
Where it may be useful, however, is in a mulitvariate from, by predicting the relationship between hot water electricity demand and non hot water electricity demand.
-->

This model uses Equation \@ref(eq:simpleLinearRegression), along with the results regarding optimal time lags for cross-covariance obtained in Section \@ref(CCVres).
From these, a simple linear model is constructed which forecasts hot water electricity use based on the previous two half-hour values of other appliance electricity use, i.e. 

\begin{equation}
  \hat x_{t} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 y_{t-1} + \gamma_2 y_{t-2}.
(\#eq:SLRres)
\end{equation}

<!--

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "rf_13LinearPlot.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:linearRelations) shows a simple linear regression of current non hot water electricity demand with the following half-hour's hot water electricity demand. This is shown to demonstrate the ability to use current electricity demand to predict hot water electricity demand over the next half hour. Note the low $R^2$ value suggesting that, in it's current form, this model would be rather inadequate at forecasting demand.

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "simpleLinear/fourHouses.pdf"))
```
Figure \@ref(fig:simpleLinear) shows the results of this model for four separate households. 
<!--
Different households used!
Note that the top two households in the figure, `rf_13` and `rf_30`, show the model fitting reasonable poorly with the data. 
Household `rf_13` appears to predict increase in hot water electricity demand before it actually occurs. 
This should be compared to Figure \@ref(fig:crossCovariance), which shows the correllation between hot water and not hot water electricity peaking at around 200 minutes lag for this household.
Household `rf_30` shows a model which appears to be very unresponsive to the data. Again, on close examination of Figure \@ref(fig:crossCovariance) we see that this household has a peak in crosscorrelation at around 800 minutes. 
This indicates that for some households, a correlation lag of greater than 30 mins may increase accuracy. 
Households `rf_42` and `rf_44` show a more accurate model result, however due to the presence of a non-zero y intercept these models will always consistently overestimate hot water electricity whenever the true value is zero.
-->
The simple linear regression model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"], 2)`W. This corresponds to a `r -round((DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"] - DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"])/DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)*100`% increase in accuracy compared to the naive model.
During peak periods this model performed particularly poorly, as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:simpleLinearResiduals). Peak-time RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"], 2)`W. This corresponds to a PEI of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"], 0)`%.

The model does not accurately capture zero values present in the actual data, and is also significantly smoother than the actual data, however no negative values are present. It scores low for physical fidelity. 
Interpretability is high, as the output can be understood easily by Equation \@ref(eq:SLRres).  
The computational time to fit models can be considered negligible.

-->

While this model would not be a very effective means of predicting hot water electricity demand on its own, it does outperform the naive model in accuracy.
This suggests that linear regression of other electricity demand may be effective as an input into more complex models that take other aspects of the data into consideration, as we see in the results for the ARIMAX and STL + ARIMAX models (Sections \@ref(ARIMAXres) and \@ref(STLARIMAXres).

```


## ARIMA model

In accordance with the procedure outlined in Section \@ref(ARIMAmethodology), ARIMA models were fitted to data from each household.
As each household has different usage patterns and characteristics, optimal values for parameters $p$ and $q$ differ for each household (refer to Equations \@ref(eq:ARMA) or \@ref(eq:ARMApolyform)).
Parameters are selected in order to minimise the AIC (Equation \@ref(eq:AIC)), and are provided in Table \@ref(tab:ARIMAparameters) in the Appendix. 
As mentioned in Section \@ref(statres), all households except `rf_40` required first-order differencing ($d = 1$) to become stationary.

The ARIMA model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a `r -round((DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"] - DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"])/DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)*100`% increase in accuracy compared to the naive model.
During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a peak period RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 0)`%.
This underperformance during peak periods is reiterated in the daily profile of residuals in Figure \@ref(fig:ARIMAresiduals).

When observing the general shape of the model prediction in Figure \@ref(fig:ARIMAplot), we see that the model returns values that are somewhat smoother than the actual data. 
However, this effect is far less pronounced than that of the linear regression model (see Figure \@ref(fig:simpleLinear)).
Occasionally, the model predicts negative values or values greater than the element is capable of.
While the shape of the model is smoother than the data, for many households it is reasonably similar.
This model therefore scores low to moderate for physical fidelity. 
Interpretability is moderate, as, given familiarity with the model, the output can be understood by the value of the $p$, $d$ and $q$ parameters. 
For a first order differenced ARIMA model ($d = 1$), the autoregressive component $p$ uses a linear regression from the most recent $p$ changes in demand to predict the following change in demand (see Equation \@ref(eq:AR)). 
Similarly, the moving average component of a first order differenced ARIMA model uses a linear regression from the previous $q$ residuals in the model to predict the following change in demand (see Equation \@ref(eq:MA2)).

The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`s. The average fitting time over all households is `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 2)`s.
While being non-negligible, these fitting times would be tolerable even when fitting models to hundreds of thousands of households.

## Seasonal ARIMA {#SARIMAres}

The periodic nature of hot water electricity demand described in Section \@ref(ACVresults) suggests that the seasonal ARIMA model would provide more accurate predicitions than the standard ARIMA model for this data. In addition, as this model falls under the 'conventional' forecasting catagory, it would be reasonable to assume it was computationally efficient. However, preliminary modelling found that the seasonal ARIMA model took an extremely long time to fit, with households taking upwards of 8 hours each to have this model fitted to their data.

The seasonal ARIMA model was originally designed to remove annual seasonality, often from financial or economic data at monthly or 3-monthly resolution.
Perhaps for this reason, the fitting alorithm is not optimised to handle data at half-hour resolution.
Significant effort was made to improve computational speed of this model, however no progress was made. The seasonal ARIMA model was therefore not pursued any further.
Seasonality of data was instead taken into consideration with an ARIMA model through the STL method, the results of which are presented in Section \@ref(STLARIMAres).

## ARIMAX model {#ARIMAXres}

As described in Section \@ref(ARIMAXmeth), the ARIMAX model may be considered as a linear regression model with an ARIMA model fitted to its errors.
In accordance with the results in Section \@ref(CCVres), the previous two values of other electricity demand were included as the regressors.
Thus Equation \@ref(eq:ARIMAX) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \hat x_t = \gamma_1y_{t-1} + \gamma_2y_{t-2} + \alpha_1 x_{t-1} + \alpha_2 x_{t-2} + ... + \alpha_p x_{t-p} + \beta_1 w_{t-1} + \beta_2 w_{t-2} + ... + \beta_q w_{t-q}.
  (\#eq:ARIMAXres)
\end{equation}

Optimal values for parameters $p$, $d$, and $q$ for the ARIMA modelled errors (see Section \@ref(ARIMAmethodology)) differ for each household, and are provided in the Appendix (Table \@ref(tab:ARIMAXparameters)).

The ARIMAX model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a `r -round((DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"] - DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"])/DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)*100`% increase in accuracy compared to the naive model.
During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a peak-time increase in RMSE of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 0)`%, indicating that the addition of the external regressors assists in peak-time accuracy when compared to the ARIMA model. 
Daily profiles of residuals are provided for reference in Figure \@ref(fig:ARIMAXresiduals).

The model shows similar behaviour to the ARIMA model with respect to the predictions being smoother than the actual data. 
Occasional negative values or values above that capable by the element occur. It scores low to moderate for physical fidelity. 
Interpretability is moderate, as the output can be understood by the values of the $p$, $d$ and $q$ parameters, along with the values given to the regressors. 
The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`s, with the average over all households taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 2)`s.

## ARIMA with STL decomposition {#STLARIMAres}

In accordance with the methods in Section \@ref(SARIMAmeth) and the results from Chapter \@ref(prelimDA), ARIMA models were fitted to household data that had been decomposed using the STL method. 
Parameters for the ARIMA component of the model are provided in Table \@ref(tab:STLARIMAparameters) in the Appendix. 
Performance of these models for four households are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:STLARIMAplot).

Our STL + ARIMA models had RMSEs ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a `r -round((DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"] - DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"])/DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)*100`% increase in accuracy compared to the naive model.
During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 2)`W.
While still losing accuracy during peak periods, with a RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 0)`%, this model had the lowest percentage increase in peak period RMSEs of all those considered in this analysis.
A daily profile of residuals is provided in Figure \@ref(fig:STLARIMAresiduals).
Note that this model was the most accurate of a selection of time series methods used to forecast volumetric residential hot water demand in [@Gelazanskas2015].
Our results come to the same conclusion, with further accuracy improvements only achieved in this research by the addition of an external regressor (presented in Section \@ref(STLARIMAXres)) or through AI methods (Section \@ref(SVMres)).

This model performs slightly worse than the standard ARIMA model for physical fidelity, as it is more likely to return negative values or values above that capable of the element. It therefore scores low for physical fidelity. 
This model is understandable as the sum of the seasonal and trend components, with an ARIMA modelled remainder. Parameters for all these elements are available, giving a general understanding of underlying patterns in the data, however it is somewhat convoluted. Interpretability therefore scores low to moderate. 
The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`s, with the average over all households taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 2)`s.

## ARIMAX with STL decomposition {#STLARIMAXres}

The most complex conventional forecasting method considered was the STL + ARIMAX model outlined in Section \@ref(STLARIMAXmeth).
This model decomposed data using the STL method in Section \@ref(STLmeth), then fits an ARIMAX model to the remainder component.
As with the other models that incorporated regression, the previous two values of other electricity demand were selected as the regressor variables.
Parameters for the ARIMA component of the model can be found in Table \@ref(tab:STLARIMAXparameters).
The performance of the model for four households is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:STLARIMAXplot).

Our STL + ARIMAX model had RMSEs ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a `r -round((DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"] - DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"])/DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)*100`% increase in accuracy compared to the naive model.
During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a peak period RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"], 0)`%. This is slightly more than that of the same model without the external regressor (STL + ARIMA).

This model essentially performs the same as the ARIMA + STL model for physical fidelity. It can be quite effective in predicting initial instances of the element turning on, although it is also more likely to return negative values or values above that capable of the element. It therefore scores low for physical fidelity. 
This model is understandable as the sum of the seasonal and trend components, with an ARIMA modelled remainder. Parameters for all these elements are available, giving a general understanding of underlying patterns in the data, however it is somewhat convoluted. Interpretability therefore scores low to moderate.

## SVM model {#SVMres}

The SVM model uses a complex machine learning algorithm in order to fit a linear regression model to highly non-linear data.
More details on this are provided in Section \@ref(SVMmeth).

The timescale of initial decay in hot water electricity demand autocorrelation (refer to Equation \@ref(eq:ACV) and Section \@ref(ACVresults)) occurred within a one hour timescale, thus the previous two values of $x$ were provided as inputs into this model.
Similarly, based on the results of cross-covariance (Equation \@ref(eq:ccv)) presented in Section \@ref(CCVres), the previous two lagged values of $y$ were also provided as inputs into this model.
In addition, the hour of the day was provided as an input to account for seasonality.
In terms of these variables, the classifying hyperplane determined in Equation \@ref(eq:GammaOrig) becomes

\begin{equation}
  \Gamma = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 h_t + \gamma_2x_{t-1} + \gamma_3 x_{t-2} + \gamma_4y_{t-1} + \gamma_5 y_{t-2}.
\end{equation}

The SVM was the most accurate model considered, with RMSEs ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W. The average over all households was `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 2)`W.
This corresponds to a `r -round((DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "SVM"] - DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"])/DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)*100`% increase in accuracy compared to the naive model.
The performance of this model for four households can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:SVMplot).
During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W, with the average over all households being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 2)`W.
This model had the highest increase in peak period RMSEs of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 0)`%, which is indicated by the daily profile of residuals in Figure \@ref(fig:SVMresiduals).

The model is slightly smoother than the actual data, and seldom displays negative values or values above what is capable of the element. It scores highly for physical fidelity. 
This model is essentially "black box", providing very limited insight as to its selected parameters and their significance. As such, it scores very low for interpretability. 
The computational time to fit models to each household was very high, varying between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`s, with the average over all households taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 2)`s.

This chapter presented the results of the models considered in this research. Quantitive values for accuracy and computational speed were provided along with a qualitative assessment of physical fidelity and interpretability. 
Values for the quantitative metrics are provided in Table \@ref(tab:summaryTab).

Figures demonstrating the performance of four households were included to provide an intuition to the shape and general performance of each model. Daily profiles of model residuals were also provided for each household. These highlight the performance of the model during peak periods, as these are the periods where smart control for demand response is most critical.
Following on from these results is Chapter \@ref(Discussion), the discussion chapter, whereby these results are compared with one another in more detail, and the implications of these results to the aims of this thesis are elucidated.
