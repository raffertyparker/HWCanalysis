# Literature review {#lit-rev}

This chapter provides an overview of the literature relevant to this thesis.
While the research conducted for this thesis did not involve any smart control, its aims are best understood through a smart control lens.
As such, this chapter begins by noting key literature relating to smart control of appliances, and any relevant findings.
Section \@ref(edf) goes on to briefly reiterate how forecasting models are constructed, and then lists a selection of models commonly used in electricity demand forecasting. It then notes other work where models were compared with one another, and the results of these comparisons.
Following this, Section \@ref(DHWM) presents key literature regarding domestic hot water simulations. A selection of physical hot water models used in research simulations are described, along with an explanation of their interrelation with demand forecasting models.
Finally, Section \@ref(similarlit) examines existing research most similar to this thesis. 
In particular, [@Gelazanskas2015] inspired much of the research in this thesis. A number of its methodologies were replicated, and its key findings were built upon in this work. To conclude this chapter, differences between [@Gelazanskas2015] and this thesis are made clear.

## Smart control {#smart-cont-lit}

Smart control research generally involves estimating the benefits associated with scheduling or otherwise adjusting the operation of suitable appliances at key times. This control is performed in order to meet a number of objectives, including:

* reducing grid peaks [@Roux2018; @Sepulveda2010; @Kepplinger2015]
* providing grid-beneficial services (instantaneous reserves) [@Kondoh2011]
* minimising costs under time-varying electricity prices [@Kepplinger2015; @Mohsenian-Rad2010; @OShaughnessy2018; @Sepulveda2010; @Cui2016; @Kapsalis2018]
* utilising low-carbon electricity [@Ramchurn2012; @Passenberg2016]
* maintaining consumer comfort under budget constraints [@Yu2013]
* improving energy efficiency [@Kepplinger2015; @Denis2019]

Insulated hot water cylinders are an example of deferrable load, and as such are good candidates for smart control [@Stephenson2018], but similar objectives can be obtained with other thermal devices such as heating and air conditioning systems [@OShaughnessy2018; @Yu2013]. This is due to the ability of thermal energy to be stored, with only slow dissipation, providing insulation is adequate. In addition, other devices such as electric vehicles and clothes washing machines/dryers may be used for smart control purposes [@Cui2016; @Mohsenian-Rad2010], as they also display some temporal flexibility around their electricity demand. 

In order to effectively schedule appliances under smart control, reasonable estimates must be made as to when they are required to be utilised. An electric vehicle, for example, must be sufficiently charged before the next use, clothes must be washed and dry in time for their next use, and a hot water cylinder must be sufficiently hot before the next shower. Accurate predictions of these 'next' usage events provide a smart control system the ability to fine tune their optimisation algorithms to take full advantage of appliance load deferrability without negatively impacting the end user.
As such, demand forecasting of appliances in some form is common in smart control literature [@Cui2016; @Roux2018; @Arghira2012; @Kepplinger2015; @Sepulveda2010; @Yu2013; @Kapsalis2018; @Passenberg2016; @Gelazanskas2016].

## Electricity demand forecasting {#edf}
<!--
Many hot water electricity demand forecasting techniques use similar methods to the simulated hot water demand component of the physical models mentioned at the beginning of this section.
The key difference is in their purpose. Rather than being run in order to simulate flow events for a physical model, they are projected into the future to obtain forecasts of demand.
When used in this manner, there is no need to be replicating physical characteristics of the hot water cylinder, thus these models focus only on understanding mathematical relationships within existing demand data. 
-->
In general, forecasting models are constructed using existing data of the variable being predicted, and, in some cases, other relevant data (regressors) that span the same period of time. The models are 'fitted' to the existing dataset such that discrepancies between the existing data and the model are minimised. Once this is completed, these models may then be projected forward in time to where no data exists in order to make predictions.
Models of this type are often fitted to electricity demand data (and any relevant regressors) for the purposes of predicting electricity demand.

While much research has been conducted on predicting grid-level [@DeFelice2013; @Jain2009], substation level [@Goude2014], or building level [@Popescu2016; @Gajowniczek2014; @Ahmad2014; @McLoughlin2013] demand, there is increasing interest in predicting the demand of individual household appliances  [@Arghira2012], including that of hot water cylinders [@Lomet2015; @Aki2016; @Denis2019].

When forecasting at grid level, research is generally focussed on effectively matching production and distribution [@Molina-Solana2017; @DeFelice2013; @Jain2009].
At building level, the prediction of energy consumption patterns are used when budgeting, negotiating and purchasing electricity contracts, and to detect electricity theft or fraud [@Molina-Solana2017; @Gajowniczek2014].
As mentioned in Section \@ref(smart-cont-lit), appliance or equipment level electricity demand forecasting is often utilised in smart control research. 
Additional purposes for appliance level forecasting include the detection of faults, and the minimisation of operation and maintenance costs [@Molina-Solana2017].

There is currently no consensus on the 'optimal' method for forecasting electricity demand.
Conventional techniques that are commonly used are either some form of time series analysis such as ARIMA [@Lomet2015; @Arghira2012; @Popescu2016, @Denis2019], regression analysis [@Wei2015; @McLoughlin2015; @Kaytez2015; @Massana2015], or a combination of the two [@DeFelice2013].

There are also a number of 'AI' methods used in electricity demand forecasting. 
These include:

* Artificial neural networks (ANNs) [@Dervilis2018; @Chitsaz2015]
* Support vector machines (SVMs) [@Aki2016; @Jain2009; @Zhang2016]
* ensemble bagging trees [@Wang2018]
* particle swarm optimisation [@Sepulveda2010]
* reinforcement learning [@Ruelens2018]
* cluster analysis [@McLoughlin2015]
* dynamic Gaussian processes [@Dervilis2018]

ANNs and SVMs are the two most common AI methods used for electricity demand forecasting [@Ahmad2014; @MatDaut2017; @Tardioli2015; @Amasyali2018; @Magoules2016].
ANNs attempt to mimic biological learning mechanisms by processing a set of training data through clusters of artificial neurons, each of which individually receive (numerical) inputs, and assign them certain weights. These weighted values are then input into other artificial neurons, which perform the same task, until eventually producing a final output.
The weights assigned by each neuron are then iteratively adjusted in order to minimise the error of the final output.
For further details regarding ANN models for forecasting electricity demand refer to  [@Magoules2016].

Despite being in common use, literature suggests that ANNs tend to be outperformed in both accuracy and computational speed by support vector machines when used for electricity demand forecasting [@Ahmad2014]. 
For this reason, they were not included in this comparative work, with support vector machines instead selected as the comparative AI method.

While much electricity demand forecasting research only considers a single model, some work has been done that compares a selection of models with one another.
Research comparing AI methods showed SVMs tend to outperform ANNs in accuracy [@Ahmad2014] while having reasonable computational speed [@Ahmad2014; @Magoules2016], whereas ANNs in particular were noted as having high computational time [@Dervilis2018].
While a comparison between AI methods in  [@Gajowniczek2014] showed that an ANN provides slightly more accurate forecasts when predicting a full day ahead, the SVM was most accurate when predicting the next hour. 
Some comparative research considers both AI and conventional methods [@Dervilis2018; @Kaytez2015; @Massana2015; @Felice2011]. 
SVMs were compared against ANNs and linear regression in [@Kaytez2015; @Massana2015], and found to be the most accurate model.
SVMs were not considered in [@Dervilis2018], which instead found an AI forecasting method called dynamic Gaussian processes to be by far the most accurate when predicting grid-level electricity load.
Dynamic Gaussian processes however were noted in [@McLoughlin2013] as being unsuitable for building level demand forecasting, and thus, we may assume, also for appliance level forecasting.

Time series and AI forecasting methods were compared against a naive benchmark model in [@Felice2011] to forecast the electricity demand of office buildings. The effects of including additional independent variables (regressors) to these models was analysed.
The regressors chosen were (i) hour of day, (ii) hot water demand, (iii) luminosity, and (iv) workday/not workday.
The addition of the regressors increased accuracy drastically in the AI methods, and slightly in the time series methods.
Overall, the time series methods had the highest accuracy, although with the addition of the external regressors to the AI method this advantage was slight.
A comprehensive review of data-driven building energy consumption prediction studies [@Amasyali2018] shows SVMs consistently outperforming ANNs in accuracy for demand forecasting, which is confirmed by another review in [@MatDaut2017]. 

Comparative research in [@Gelazanskas2015] considers a number of time series analysis methods for forecasting volumetric residential hot water demand.
These models were fitted to volumetric hot water data collected from 95 UK households. 
Similar to the research undertaken for this thesis, they also used the `R` programming language, and used simplistic models as benchmarks by which to compare other models to (see Sections \@ref(naivemeth) and \@ref(snaivemeth)). 
They explored a number of time series models for prediction, including exponential smoothing, ARIMA, seasonal decomposition by local polynomial regression (STL), and combinations of these.
Predictions were made for hourly intervals up to 24 hours ahead, and models were compared against one another for accuracy.
Their most accurate model, a combination of STL and ARIMA, achieved prediction accuracy more than 50% above their benchmark models.
Forecasts were also constructed for aggregated demand data, that is, the demand of all the households added together.
Accuracy of all models considered was improved when aggregating data in this manner.

Some demand forecasting models, particularly those using conventional forecasting methods, are reasonably easy to interpret. Once they have been fitted to the data, their parameters can be extracted to provide statistical insights into the behaviour behind the data.
This is valuable for building 'physical' domestic hot water computer models, as their parameters can be used to construct more accurate simulations of hot water demand, a necessary component of these models [@Lomet2015].

## Domestic hot water modelling {#DHWM}

As a physical roll-out of smart controllers would be prohibitively expensive for research purposes, much existing smart control research uses simulations to determine the potential of smart control [@Yu2013; @Roux2018; @JackDew2018; @Ruelens2018; @Passenberg2016; @Aki2016; @Kondoh2011; @Roux2017; @Denis2019; @Gelazanskas2016; @Kapsalis2018].
In the context of researching a physical system under smart control, simulations are created using known physical and statistical properties of the system.
Physical properties are determined through an understanding of the physics of the system.
Statistical properties tend to be determined using existing data collected from the physical system, or relevant subsets of the system.
Simulations then use these properties to create (simulate) new data that mimics that which would be obtained if this system was constructed in reality. 
Parameters of the system being simulated are able to be altered to see how this affects the outputs being studied [@JackDew2018].

<!--
While simulations may be projected into the future, and therefore used for forecasting, they tend to artificially create fluctuations about the outputs that would have been provided using purely the statistical properties.
This provides more realistic outputs, as real world systems almost never behave nicely according to their statistical properties.
However, the addition of these fluctuations (known as 'noise') is not necessary when the purpose is minimising the error in the prediction of a future value.
Instead, when attempting to minimise the error of a prediction, more simple forecasting models can be utilised.
-->

Domestic hot water modelling refers to the process of building simulations of a residential hot water cylinder and its operation.
In the wider context of computer modelling, these are referred to as 'physical' models.
While all models are less accurate than the systems they replicate, analyses that utilise computer models have a number of crucial benefits over real-world alternatives.
Firstly, a well-constructed physical model provides the ability to make an analysis regarding alterations to the physical system that may be difficult or expensive to carry out in reality. 
Secondly, physical models provide the ability to ‘speed up’ the passing of time, and to be run ‘into the future’, two features currently unavailable when conducting real-world analyses. 
Hot water cylinder models may be utilised for a number of applications.
Some represent the physical system, with all its temperature gradients and heat and fluid flows, to a high degree of accuracy [@Kong2016; @Yaici2013]. These are suited for analyses as to the effects of making physical changes to the system, such as adjusting the position of the outlet [@Kong2016; @Yaici2013] or cylinder dimensions [@Yaici2013]. However, a high degree of physical accuracy comes with high computational cost.
The more physically simplistic models are more suitable for analyses that span over longer periods of time such as weeks, months or years, as is necessary in simulations of smart control scenarios.

Generally speaking, a domestic hot water model will consist of both a mathematical description of the physical system, and a mathematical or statistical description of the flow of hot water out of the tank, that is, hot water demand. 
A mathematical representation of the physical cylinder must, at a minimum, take into consideration the internal temperature effects of inflows of cold and outflows of hot water, heat input into the cylinder from the element, and heat loss from the walls of the cylinder.
Water temperature(s) within the cylinder are important, both for heat flow calculations, and for determining if and when the cylinder has run out of hot water.
In a cylinder of warm water at equilibrium a temperature difference between the top and bottom of the cylinder naturally arises. This can be described in terms of three distinct volumes of water. At the bottom of the cylinder, there is a volume of cooler water, with only a slight change in temperature from the bottom to the top of it. At the top, a volume of warmer water, again with only a slight vertical temperature gradient.
These are separated by a thin volume of water known as the thermocline, whereby a rapid change in temperature occurs between its top and bottom [@JackDew2018].

Some models choose to simplify this heat distribution within the tank, considering it instead to be one well-mixed, single temperature volume of water [@Heleno2015; @Parra2016; @Roux2017]. This method has the benefit of being computationally inexpensive, allowing for temporally extensive analyses to be carried out, to the detriment of some physical accuracy.
Other models simplify the heat distribution as two well-mixed bodies of water at the top and bottom, separated by a thermocline of negligible width [@JackDew2018; @Booysen2017; @Nel2018].
While requiring more computer resources than the single-volume models, the two-volume models still a provide relatively computationally inexpensive means of analysing hot water usage, while capturing some additional physical characteristics such as the rapid ‘running out’ of hot water.
A schematic of a two-volume model is provided in Fig. \@ref(fig:twoVolume)
Finally, some hot water cylinder models use computational fluid dynamics software to maintain very high amounts of physical accuracy, essentially allowing the determination of water temperature at any point within the cylinder [@Kong2016; @Yaici2013]. 

(ref:twoVol) A schematic representing a two-volume physical model of a hot water cylinder [@JackDew2018].

```{r twoVolume, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='(ref:twoVol)'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "schematic.pdf"))
```
Within these models there must be the ability to simulate the demand of hot water.
The model in [@Heleno2015] simply schedules three 35L, 38° hot water events at three separate times through the day.
The model in [@JackDew2018] simulates domestic hot water usage by assuming up to three major use events (representing showers, bathing etc.) that are random and normally distributed about fixed times of day, with additional minor usage events (representing hand washing etc.) having equal probability of occurring between specified intervals at other times.
For much of the hot water cylinder research previously mentioned however, the methodology around demand simulation is not clearly elucidated. 

Statistical insights gained from parameters within appropriate demand forecasting models have the potential to be incorporated into physical models to simulate demand. This would improve how accurately these physical models represent reality [@Lomet2015], in turn improving accuracy of results from smart control simulations.
The research conducted for this thesis does not use any physical models. 
However, when the forecasting models that are used in this thesis are compared to one another, suitability for incorporation into a physical model is considered (see Section \@ref(metrics)).

The use of physical models alongside forecasting models in a smart control algorithm has been previously researched in [@Kepplinger2015]. 
Residential hot water demand forecasts with Austrian electricity spot price data were provided as inputs in a smart control simulation of hot water cylinders. 
This was optimised to arbitrage spot market electricity prices and/or reduce overall energy demand.
Cost savings of up to 12% were demonstrated when optimising for price arbitrage, and energy savings of up to 12% were demonstrated when optimising for energy efficiency.

## Model selection

Every forecasting model has unique strengths and weaknesses that render it more or less suitable to the aims of this thesis outlined in Section \@ref(Aims).
Based on suitability to meet these aims, some models encountered within existing literature were selected for further investigation, while others were disregarded.

This research places emphasis on the ARIMA and related models, as existing literature suggested these would have a reasonable performance over all the comparative metrics (detailed in Section \@ref(metrics)). 
For the same reason, SVMs were chosen as a representative AI method.
ANNs were not investigated in any depth, as they appeared to require high performance computational resources to execute in a timely manner while not offering accuracy improvements over SVMs. 
We are interested in predictions based only on data that would be available from any smart meter with a separately metered hot water cylinder, as is commonly available in New Zealand today.
For this reason, models that rely on the availability of external data were not utilised, although some regression was carried out using other appliances as the regressor variable.

<!--As this work is concerned mainly with making predictions only half an hour into the future, time series methods that attempt to uncover longer-term trends in averages are also not relevant.-->

This chapter indicated that much groundwork has been done in the existing literature as to which models would be good candidates for predicting residential hot water electricity demand.
A selection of promising models were chosen for comparison based on their performance and/or prevalence in existing literature. These are described in more detail in the methodology chapter that follows.

## Relationship between this thesis and existing literature {#similarlit}

In this section, we compare the aims of this thesis (see Section \@ref(Aims)) to the existing literature.

While there is some existing research that compares electricity demand forecasting models, comparisons generally only consider accuracy of predictions.
When computational costs are mentioned, they are qualitative, and given little focus [@Amasyali2018]. 
There is very little consideration within existing literature to utilising parameters from forecasting models in order to simulate demand within a physical model [@Lomet2015].
While the researchers in [@Felice2011] use hot water demand as a regressor to improve prediction of total building electricity demand, no research was found that used the electricity demand of other appliances as a regressor to improve prediction of hot water electricity demand.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing literature that compares a range of models to forecast residential hot water electricity demand.
Within the existing literature, the piece of research most similar to that conducted for this thesis is that of Gelažanskas and Gamage in [@Gelazanskas2015]. 
While this thesis draws on the key findings within this research, it differs in a number of ways, which are shown in Table \@ref(tab:gelazanskasComparison).
