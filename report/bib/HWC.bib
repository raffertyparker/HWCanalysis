abstract = {We propose a hybrid approach for the modeling and the short-term forecasting of electricity loads. Two building blocks of our approach are (1) modeling the overall trend and seasonality by fitting a generalized additive model to the weekly averages of the load and (2) modeling the dependence structure across consecutive daily loads via curve linear regression. For the latter, a new methodology is proposed for linear regression with both curve response and curve regressors. The key idea behind the proposed methodology is dimension reduction based on a singular value decomposition in a Hilbert space, which reduces the curve regression problem to several ordinary (i.e., scalar) linear regression problems. We illustrate the hybrid method using French electricity loads between 1996 and 2009, on which we also compare our method with other available models including th{\'{e}} Electricit́e de France operational model.

Forecasting electricity usage is an important task to provide intelligence to the smart gird. Accurate forecasting will enable a utility provider to plan the resources and also to take control actions to balance the electricity supply and demand. The customers will benefit from metering solutions through greater understanding of their own energy consumption and future projections, allowing them to better manage costs of their usage. In this proof of concept paper, our contribution is the proposal for accurate short term electricity load forecasting for 24 hours ahead, not on the aggregate but on the individual household level.},

abstract = {Globally, renewable generation is growing rapidly, and the next few decades are likely to see many consumers adopting new grid-connected technologies such as electric vehicles, photovoltaics and energy management systems. However, these ‘greener' and smarter' changes could create significant challenges for power quality, safety and other aspects of grid management. We describe how New Zealand is an ideal research environment for combining smart grid capability with integration of high levels of renewables, as it already has around 80{\%} renewable generation, and advanced metering infrastructure in over 62{\%} of households. Challenges for achieving a greener, smarter grid identified in the GREEN Grid research programme include managing the increased variability in supply, especially from the growing use of wind and solar generation; the potential for power quality and congestion issues from high levels of small scale distributed generation; the need for increased frequency keeping and instantaneous reserves as variability increases; and the relatively low level of consumer engagement in demand response which could ideally assist with variability. In this paper we describe the methodology and approach used in the research programme, and note some initial findings that may help address these issues, including the benefits of geographically distributed wind farms to reduce overall wind variability; the development of a hosting capacity tool for small scale distributed generation; a proposal for new ancillary services to help manage (and cover the costs of) increased variability; and the increased use of hot water cylinders for demand response. As the research programme continues to move forward with developing mechanisms for managing a smart green grid, the findings are likely to have widespread relevance to other nations that are seeking high levels of renewable generation.},

This model is a pretest-posttest design, with the most basic limitation being that without a control group, there may be sources of bias and/or competing extraneous confounding factors that offer a plausible rationale explaining the change from baseline. Furthermore, with the current inclination of DM programs to use financial indicators rather than program-specific utilization indicators as the principal measure of program success, additional biases are introduced that may cloud evaluation results. This paper presents a non-technical introduction to time-series analysis (using disease-specific utilization measures) as an alternative, and more appropriate, approach to evaluating DM program effectiveness than the current total population approach.},

abstract = {Electricity load forecasting is crucial for effective operation and management of buildings. Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been successfully used in solving nonlinear regression and time series problems related to building energy consumption forecasting. As the performance of SVR heavily depends on the selection of its parameters, differential evolution (DE) algorithm is employed in this study to solve this problem. The forecasting model is developed using weighted SVR models with nu-SVR and epsilon-SVR. The DE algorithm is again used to determine the weights corresponding to each model. A case of time series energy consumption data from an institutional building in Singapore is used to elucidate the performance of the proposed model. The proposed model can be used to forecast both, half-hourly and daily electricity consumption time series data for the same building. The results show that for half-hourly data, the model exhibits higher weight for nu-SVR, whereas for daily data, a higher weight for epsilon-SVR is observed. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for daily energy consumption data is 5.843 and that for half-hourly energy consumption is 3.767 respectively. A detailed comparison with other evolutionary algorithms show that the proposed model yields higher accuracy for building energy consumption forecasting.},

abstract = {Electricity load forecasting plays a key role in operation of power systems. Since the penetration of distributed and renewable generation is increasingly growing in many countries, Short-Term Load Forecast (STLF) of micro-grids is also becoming an important task. A precise STLF of the micro-grid can enhance the management of its renewable and conventional resources and improve the economics of energy trade with electricity markets. As a consequence of the highly non-smooth and volatile behavior of the load time series in a micro-grid, its STLF is even a more complex process than that of a power system. For this purpose, a new prediction method is proposed in this paper, in which a Self-Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network (SRWNN) is applied as the forecast engine. Moreover, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm is implemented and adapted to train the SRWNN. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, it is examined on real-world hourly data of an educational building within a micro-grid. Comparisons with other load prediction methods are provided.},

abstract = {This paper discusses time series approaches, often used by Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to forecast system demand, and applies them at an individual dwelling level. In particular, two techniques, Fourier transforms and Gaussian processes were evaluated and used to characterise individual household electricity demand. The performance of the characterisation approaches were evaluated based on Pearson correlation coefficient, descriptive statistics and paired sample . t-tests for electrical parameters: Total Electricity Consumption, Maximum Demand, Load Factor and Time of Use of maximum electricity demand. Finally, a number of time series tests were carried out to ensure certain properties remained between the original and characterised series.Both Fourier transforms and Gaussian processes were shown to be suitable techniques for characterising domestic electricity demand. Depending on customer demand load profiles, each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses. Fourier transforms are better at characterising the profiles of customers who consume electricity more evenly across the day ({\textgreater}1 h). In contrast, Gaussian processes are better at characterising customers whose demand is high for only short periods of time (≤1 h) throughout the day. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The availability of increasing amounts of data to electricity utilities through the implementation of domestic smart metering campaigns has meant that traditional ways of analysing meter reading information such as descriptive statistics has become increasingly difficult. Key characteristic information to the data is often lost, particularly when averaging or aggregation processes are applied. Therefore, other methods of analysing data need to be used so that this information is not lost. One such method which lends itself to analysing large amounts of information is data mining. This allows for the data to be segmented before such aggregation processes are applied. Moreover, segmentation allows for dimension reduction thus enabling easier manipulation of the data.Clustering methods have been used in the electricity industry for some time. However, their use at a domestic level has been somewhat limited to date. This paper investigates three of the most widely used unsupervised clustering methods: k-means, k-medoid and Self Organising Maps (SOM). The best performing technique is then evaluated in order to segment individual households into clusters based on their pattern of electricity use across the day. The process is repeated for each day over a six month period in order to characterise the diurnal, intra-daily and seasonal variations of domestic electricity demand. Based on these results a series of Profile Classes (PC's) are presented that represent common patterns of electricity use within the home. Finally, each PC is linked to household characteristics by applying a multi-nominal logistic regression to the data. As a result, households and the manner with which they use electricity in the home can be characterised based on individual customer attributes.},

The comparison between measured and modelled values indicates that model well captures the characteristics of domestic electricity load profiles on a daily as well seasonal basis. For high-resolution data, the model represents well the differences in demand between households of dissimilar size as well as the diversity of demand between households of the same size. For the individual household, the high-end power consumption is under-represented since the timing of peaks is more diverse in the model.},

In this paper, we only present the methods that showed the best results. For electric load forecasting, our strategy consists of producing temperature scenarios that we then plug into a probabilistic forecasting load model. Both steps are performed by fitting a quantile generalized additive model (quantGAM). Concerning the electricity price forecasting, we investigate three methods that we used during the competition. The first method follows the spirit of that used for the electric load. The second one is based on combining a set of individual predictors. The last one fits a sparse linear regression to a large set of covariates. We chose to present these three methods in this paper because they perform well and show the potential for improvements in future research.},

abstract = {The recent advent of smart meters has led to large micro-level datasets. For the first time, the electricity consumption at individual sites is available on a near real-time basis. Efficient management of energy resources, electric utilities, and transmission grids, can be greatly facilitated by harnessing the potential of this data. The aim of this study is to generate probability density estimates for consumption recorded by individual smart meters. Such estimates can assist decision making by helping consumers identify and minimize their excess electricity usage, especially during peak times. For suppliers, these estimates can be used to devise innovative time-of-use pricing strategies aimed at their target consumers. We consider methods based on conditional kernel density (CKD) estimation with the incorporation of a decay parameter. The methods capture the seasonality in consumption, and enable a nonparametric estimation of its conditional density. Using 8 months of half-hourly data for 1000 meters. we evaluate point and density forecasts, for lead times ranging from one half-hour up to a week ahead. We find that the kernel-based methods outperform a simple benchmark method that does not account for seasonality, and compare well with an exponential smoothing method that we use as a sophisticated benchmark. To gauge the financial impact, we use density estimates of consumption to derive prediction intervals of electricity cost for different time-of-use tariffs. We show that a simple strategy of switching between different tariffs, based on a comparison of cost densities, delivers significant cost savings for the great majority of consumers.},

abstract = {Broadly speaking, building energy use prediction can be classified into two categories based on modeling approaches namely engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While engineering approach requires solving physical equations representing the thermal performance of systems and components that constitute the buildings, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future performance. Although engineering approach estimates energy use with greater accuracy, it falls short in the overall complexity of model building and simulation in which detailed data that represent the building geometry, systems, configurations, and occupant schedule is needed. Whereas, the AI-based approach offers a rapid prediction of building energy use and, if appropriately trained and tested, may be used for quick and efficient decision-making of energy use reduction. Nevertheless, for robust integration with and to improve automated building systems management and intelligence, the need for consistent, stable, and higher prediction accuracy cannot be understated. To alleviate the instability issue, and to improve prediction accuracy, we have exploited and tested an ensemble learning technique, ‘Ensemble Bagging Trees' (EBT), using data obtained from meteorological systems and building-level occupancy and meters.Results showed that the proposed EBT model predicted hourly electricity demand of the test building with improved accuracy of Mean Absolute Prediction Error that ranged from 2.97{\%} to 4.63{\%}. Additionally, results showed that proposed variable selection method could reduce the computation time of EBT by 38–41{\%} without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. The proposed ensemble learning model that exemplifies improved prediction accuracy over other AI techniques can be used for real-time applications such as system fault detection and diagnosis.},

For distribution net- work managers, a good knowledge of the future electricity con- sumption stands as a central point for the reliability of the net- work and investment strategies. In this paper, we suggest a semi- parametric approach based on generalized additivemodels theory to model electrical load over more than 2200 substations of the French distribution network, and this at both short and middle term horizons. These generalized additive models estimate the re- lationship between load and the explanatory variables: tempera- tures, calendar variables, etc. This methodology has been applied with good results on the French grid. In addition, we highlight the fact that the estimated functions describing the relations between demand and the driving variables are easily interpretable, and that a good temperature prediction is important.},

abstract = {Since the inception of competitive power markets two decades ago, electricity price forecasting (EPF) has gradually become a fundamental process for energy companies' decision making mechanisms. Over the years, the bulk of research has concerned point predictions. However, the recent introduction of smart grids and renewable integration requirements has had the effect of increasing the uncertainty of future supply, demand and prices. Academics and practitioners alike have come to understand that probabilistic electricity price (and load) forecasting is now more important for energy systems planning and operations than ever before. With this paper we offer a tutorial review of probabilistic EPF and present much needed guidelines for the rigorous use of methods, measures and tests, in line with the paradigm of ‘maximizing sharpness subject to reliability'. The paper can be treated as an update and a further extension of the otherwise comprehensive EPF review of Weron [1] or as a standalone treatment of a fascinating and underdeveloped topic, that has a much broader reach than EPF itself.},

Two building blocks of our approach are (i) modelling the overall trend and seasonality by fitting a generalised additive model to the weekly averages of the load, and (ii) modelling the dependence structure across consecutive daily loads via curve linear regression. For the latter, a new methodology is proposed for linear regression with both curve response and curve regressors. The key idea behind the proposed methodology is the dimension reduction based on a singular value decomposition in a Hilbert space, which reduces the curve regression problem to several ordinary (i.e. scalar) linear regression problems. We illustrate the hybrid method using the French electricity loads between 1996 and 2009, on which we also compare our method with other available models including the EDF operational model.},

These methods are making energy demand adaptive to fluctuations inherent to intermittent renewable energy sources. In order to develop feasible demand-side management solutions, a better understanding of the temporality of the energy demand is needed. This paper contributes to this by focusing on the daily load profiles of energy demand for heating of Danish dwellings with heat pumps. Based on hourly recordings from 139 dwellings and employing cluster and regression analysis, the paper explores patterns (typologies) in daily heating load profiles and how these relate to socio-economic and technical characteristics of the included households. The study shows that the load profiles vary according to the external load conditions. Two main clusters were identified for both weekdays and weekends and across load segments; a main cluster with a relatively constant load profile and a minor cluster with a more distinct variation during the day. The difference between the clusters is primarily correlated with building characteristics like floor area, building year and type of space heating distribution system, while the existence of children and teenagers in the household were the only significant socio-economic variables.},

abstract = {The electrification of residential energy demand for heating and transportation is expected to increase peak load and require additional generation and transmission capacities. Electrification also provides an opportunity to increase demand response. With a focus on household electricity consumption, we analyse the contribution of appliances and new services, such as individual heat pumps and electric vehicles, to peak consumption and the need for demand response incentives to reduce the peak. Initially, the paper presents a new model that represents the hourly electricity consumption profile of households in Denmark. The model considers hourly consumption profiles for different household appliances and their contribution to annual household electricity consumption. When applying the model to an official scenario for annual electricity consumption, assuming non-flexible consumption due to a considerable introduction of electric vehicles and individual heat pumps, household consumption is expected to increase considerably, especially peak hour consumption is expected to increase. Next the paper presents results from a new experiment where household customers are given economic and/or environmental incentives to shift consumption to or away from specified hours. The experiment focuses on the present classic consumption and shows that household customers do react to incentives, but today the flexibility of the classic consumption is limited. Considering electric vehicles and individual heat pumps, for an individual household, the consumption of each of these technologies roughly doubles the household's consumption and considerably increases their potential for flexibility. Thus, in order to introduce incentives for demand flexibility, while considering reducing peak consumption, policy makers should initially focus on households that have a heat pump and/or an electric vehicle.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as one of the future disruptive technologies, which has the potential to bring positive change in human lifestyle and uplift living standards. Many IoT-based applications have been designed in various fields, e.g., security, health, education, manufacturing, transportation, etc. IoT has transformed conventional homes into Smart homes. By attaching small IoT devices to various appliances, we cannot only monitor but also control indoor environment as per user demand. Intelligent IoT devices can also be used for optimal energy utilization by operating the associated equipment only when it is needed. In this paper, we have proposed a Hidden Markov Model based algorithm to predict energy consumption in Korean residential buildings using data collected through smart meters. We have used energy consumption data collected from four multi-storied buildings located in Seoul, South Korea for model validation and results analysis. Proposed model prediction results are compared with three well-known prediction algorithms i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Comparative analysis shows that our proposed model achieves 2.96{\%} better than ANN results in terms of root mean square error metric, 6.09{\%} better than SVM and 9.03{\%} better than CART results. To further establish and validate prediction results of our proposed model, we have performed temporal granularity analysis. For this purpose, we have evaluated our proposed model for hourly, daily and weekly data aggregation. Prediction accuracy in terms of root mean square error metric for hourly, daily and weekly data is 2.62, 1.54 and 0.46, respectively. This shows that our model prediction accuracy improves for coarse grain data. Higher prediction accuracy gives us confidence to further explore its application in building control systems for achieving better energy efficiency.},

The literature shows that these values justify the incremental costs of solar plus devices for a wide variety of technologies, geographies, and customer load profiles, especially for customers in three rate structure contexts: where PV is sold to the grid at a lower value than the customer's retail rate, in time-of-use rates where peak periods do not coincide with PV output, and in demand charge rates where load peaks do not coincide with PV output. Rate structure and policy reform may be necessary to ensure that increasing solar plus deployment provides both end-user and system-level benefits.},

abstract = {Electric water heaters are responsible for a large portion of electricity consumption and water usage in the domestic sector. Smart water heaters alleviate the strain on the electricity supply grid and reduce water consumption through behavioural change, but the installation of in-line flow meters is inconvenient and expensive. A non-invasive water flow meter is proposed as an alternative. Non-invasive flow measurement is more common for high flow rates in the industrial sector than for domestic applications. Various non-invasive water measurement methods are investigated in the context of domestic hot water, and a combination of thermal- and vibration-sensing is proposed. The proposed solution uses inexpensive, easily installable, non-invasive sensors and a novel algorithm to provide the same flow measurement accuracy as existing in-line meters. The algorithm detects the beginning and end of water consumption events with an accuracy of 95.6{\%}. Quantitative flow rate estimation was possible for flow rates greater than 5 L min−1 with an accuracy of 89{\%}, while volumetric usage estimation had an accuracy of more than 93{\%}. The algorithm limitations were applied to field data, revealing that water consumption could be detected with an error of less than 12{\%} within the limitations of the proposed algorithm. The paper presents a successful proof of concept for a non-invasive alternative to domestic hot water flow rate measurement.},

Its performance was evaluated through simulation assuming a day-ahead real-time pricing (DA-RTP) tariff and a time-varying bound on power consumption, taking into account the user's daily hot water consumption rate. A comparison between the proposed heuristic algorithm and an optimal scheduling algorithm showed identical performance, in terms of energy cost reduction. Also, a parametric analysis studied the effect of several critical parameters (maximum water tank temperature, EWH's rated power and capacity) on the performance of the scheduling algorithm.

abstract = {Most of the existing demand-side management programs focus primarily on the interactions between a utility company and its customers/users. In this paper, we present an autonomous and distributed demand-side energy management system among users that takes advantage of a two-way digital communication infrastructure which is envisioned in the future smart grid. We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach can reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the total energy demand, the total energy costs, as well as each user's individual daily electricity charges.},

abstract = {With dwindling non-renewable energy reserves and the adverse effects of climate change, the development of the smart electricity grid is seen as key to solving global energy security issues and to reducing carbon emissions. In this respect, there is a growing need to integrate renewable (or green) energy sources in the grid. However, the intermittency of these energy sources requires that demand must also be made more responsive to changes in supply, and a number of smart grid technologies are being developed, such as high-capacity batteries and smart meters for the home, to enable consumers to be more responsive to conditions on the grid in real-time. Traditional solutions based on these technologies, however, tend to ignore the fact that individual consumers will behave in such a way that best satisfies their own preferences to use or store energy (as opposed to that of the supplier or the grid operator). Hence, in practice, it is unclear how these solutions will cope with large numbers of consumers using their devices in this way. Against this background, in this paper, we develop novel control mechanisms based on the use of autonomous agents to better incorporate consumer preferences in managing demand. These agents, residing on consumers' smart meters, can both communicate with the grid and optimise their owner's energy consumption to satisfy their preferences. More specifically, we provide a novel control mechanism that models and controls a system comprising of a green energy supplier operating within the grid and a number of individual homes (each possibly owning a storage device). This control mechanism is based on the concept of homeostasis whereby control signals are sent to individual components of a system, based on their continuous feedback, in order to change their state so that the system may reach a stable equilibrium. Thus, we define a new carbon-based pricing mechanism for this green energy supplier that takes advantage of carbon-intensity signals available on the internet in order to provide real-time pricing. The pricing scheme is designed in such a way that it can be readily implemented using existing communication technologies and is easily understandable by consumers. Building upon this, we develop new control signals that the supplier can use to incentivise agents to shift demand (using their storage device) to times when green energy is available. Moreover, we show how these signals can be adapted according to changes in supply and to various degrees of penetration of storage in the system. We empirically evaluate our system and show that, when all homes are equipped with storage devices, the supplier can significantly reduce its reliance on other carbon-emitting power sources to cater for its own shortfalls. By so doing, the supplier reduces the carbon emission of the system by up to 25{\%} while the consumer reduces its costs by up to 14.5{\%}. Finally, we demonstrate that our homeostatic control mechanism is not sensitive to small prediction errors and the supplier is incentivised to accurately predict its green production to minimise costs.},

A mixed integer multi-time scale stochastic optimization is formulated for the scheduling of loads of different characteristics. A model predictive control based heuristic is proposed. Numerical simulations coupled with real data measurements are used for performance evaluation and comparison studies.},

abstract = {Power systems' operators have the task of maintaining the balance between the demand and generation of electric power. Much research and attention is being given to find more environmental friendly sources of power generation. Naturally, more power is required when the load is at its peak value, and this tends to be when the most non environmentally friendly sources of power generation are used. This paper proposes a new controller for peak load shaving by intelligently scheduling power consumption of domestic electric water heater using binary particle swarm optimization. Past studies show that similar demand side management programs were not successful because the impact that the load control has on the end users' comfort. In this study, Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) finds the optimal load demand schedule for minimizing the peak load demand while maximizing customer comfort level. A simulation in Matlab is used to test the performance of the demand response program using field data gathered by smart meters from 200 households. The direct load control is shown to be an effective tool for peak shaving of load demand, shifting the loads to valleys and reducing the aggregated load of electricity without compromising customer satisfaction.},

abstract = {The growing share of electricity generation from renewable energy creates difficulties in maintaining the balance of generation and demand. This is mainly due to uncertainties caused by prediction errors in renewable generation. In order to maintain power system security, the participation of demand side response to the balancing services such as operating reserve is critical. In this paper, the capability of smart appliances to act as operating reserves for the system operator is investigated. The smart appliances considered are washing machines, dish washers and tumble dryers equipped with communication modules. A novel framework is introduced which enables system operators to access demand response from smart appliances in a timeframe suitable for operating reserves. A mathematical model is developed to simulate appliances with multiple discrete power phases. The delay and interruption of appliances cycles are considered in the model. A multiple time-step simulation is introduced that assesses the load reduction from a number of households as a response to a reserve instruction which is modelled as a price increase with a short notification period. The results are used to estimate the available demand response from Great Britain (GB) households at any moment of the day. With a 20{\%} penetration of smart appliances, the demand response can provide up to 54{\%} of the operating reserve requirements of the GB power system depending on the time of day.},

A B S T R A C T In many countries domestic electric hot water storage cylinders have high penetration and account for a large proportion of electricity demand. Their ability to store energy makes them a significant opportunity for emerging smart home energy management systems. One approach to evaluating the potential of hot water cylinders under smart control is to simulate electricity demand via a physical model of a cylinder together with assumed hot water usage patterns. Determining the accuracy of these simulations is made difficult by the lack of detailed data on cylinder variables and household hot water usage. This results in simulation methods that potentially miss essential features or are overly complex. To address this issue, we first propose a statistical fidelity measure that can be used to compare simulated with monitored electricity demand time series from an individual cylinder. We then present a minimal simulation method that achieves reasonable fidelity with monitored demand. The proposed method is particularly useful for simulating individual households using only electricity time-series data for the purpose of evaluating smart home management scenarios.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Globally, renewable generation is growing rapidly, and the next few decades are likely to see many consumers adopting new grid-connected technologies such as electric vehicles, photovoltaics and energy management systems. However, these 'greener' and smarter' changes could create significant challenges for power quality, safety and other aspects of grid management. We describe how New Zealand is an ideal research environment for combining smart grid capability with integration of high levels of renewables, as it already has around 80{\%} renewable generation, and advanced metering infrastructure in over 62{\%} of households. Challenges for achieving a greener, smarter grid identified in the GREEN Grid research programme include managing the increased variability in supply, especially from the growing use of wind and solar generation; the potential for power quality and congestion issues from high levels of small scale distributed generation; the need for increased frequency keeping and instantaneous reserves as variability increases; and the relatively low level of consumer engagement in demand response which could ideally assist with variability. In this paper we describe the methodology and approach used in the research programme, and note some initial findings that may help address these issues, including the benefits of geographically distributed wind farms to reduce overall wind variability; the development of a hosting capacity tool for small scale distributed generation; a proposal for new ancillary services to help manage (and cover the costs of) increased variability; and the increased use of hot water cylinders for demand response. As the research programme continues to move forward with developing mechanisms for managing a smart green grid, the findings are likely to have widespread relevance to other nations that are seeking high levels of renewable generation.},

abstract = {Hot water energy use is a large component of New Zealand's total residential energy use. Accurate estimates of the future demand for hot water energy use require an accurate understanding of the social drivers and physical processes involved with hot water usage and storage. Changes in society (such as an aging population) and changes in the physical properties of hot water systems (such as increasing the insulation level of hot water cylinders) will impact on the energy used for hot water in households. This paper undertakes a preliminary examination of New Zealand's residential hot water usage. Results from the initial stages of the Household Energy End-Use Project (HEEP) are used to derive standing losses and hot water usage from measurement. The analysis of the physical properties of the hot water systems allow comparisons of theoretical assumptions from standards and other guidelines concerning the standing losses, thermostat settings and usage frequency with actually measured data. The collection and analysis of socio-demographic data allows for the study of hot water demand which has implications in a wide range of areas such as the sizing of hot water systems and pricing options. Further analysis will be undertaken as the HEEP work progresses. Keywords:},

The relatively low utilisation of generation and networks (of about 50{\%}) means that there is significant scope for DSM to contribute to increasing the efficiency of the system investment. The importance of the diversity of electricity load is discussed and the negative effects of DSM on load diversity illustrated. Ageing assets, the growth in renewable and other low-carbon generation technologies and advances in information and communication technologies are identified as major additional drivers that could lead to wider applications of DSM in the medium term. Potential benefits of DSM are discussed in the context of generation and of transmission and distribution networks. The provision of back-up capacity by generation may not be efficient as it will be needed relatively infrequently, and DSM may be better placed to support security. We also present an analysis of the value of DSM in balancing generation and demand in a future UK electricity system with significant variable renewable generation. We give a number of reasons for the relatively slow uptake of DSM, particularly in the residential, commercial and small business sectors. They include a lack of metering, information and communication infrastructure, lack of understanding of the benefits of DSM, problems with the competitiveness of DSM when compared with traditional approaches, an increase in the complexity of system operation and inappropriate market incentives. {\textcopyright} 2008 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.},

We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different "P2Y"-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To "functionalize" or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be promising.},

Especially, the influence of the DHW production type used is evaluated as well as the water tank insulation. To that end, real consumption measurements are used for model training. Then simulations are run on using TRNSYS software to compute the total energy consumption of DHW production systems over 1 year. Simulations are also based on real consumption measurements for realistic results. To appraise the energy savings, we compared simulations that consider either no forecast (reactive control), perfect forecast (to estimate the control ability to consider forecast), or the forecast provided by our algorithm. The measurements and simulations are run on 26 different but real dwellings to assess results variability. Several system configurations are also compared with varying thermal insulation indices for a complete benchmark of the approach so that an overall performance of the system and the anticipation strategy could be evaluated.},

abstract = {Recent advances in smart grid technology enable new approaches to address the problem of load control for domestic water heating. Since water heaters store energy, they are well-suited to load management. However, existing approaches have focused on the electrical supply side, ignoring the obvious link between the user and the grid: individual hot water consumption patterns. This paper proposes a load spreading approach in which water heaters compete for access to the heating medium. The proposed smart grid solution takes grid load limits, real-time temperature measurements, water usage patterns, individual user comfort, and heater meta-data into consideration. The scheduler only turns on the heaters with the highest level of need, but limits the number of on heaters to ensure that the grid load stays below a set limit for a set time. The method is evaluated by simulation against various heater set temperature levels, and for various load limits, and compared with ripple control and actual consumption measured in a field trial of 34 water heaters. The proposed algorithm reduces the load from 62 kW to 20, 30, 40, and 50 kW (vs. 106 kW for full ripple control). The resulting number of unwanted cold events is fewer than for ripple control, and only slightly more than no control, while reducing the total energy by 14{\%} from a user-optimised natural experiment.},

abstract = {Electric domestic hot water heaters are well suited for demand side management, as they possess high nominal power ratings combined with large thermal buffer capacities. In this paper, their potential for demand side management via pseudo cost functions is studied. A fully mixed thermal model of the water heater is used to formulate the optimization problem as a binary integer program, whereas a multi-layer model is used to simulate actual system behavior. The current approach requires only one-way communication of a pseudo cost function, which may depend upon factors such as expected electricity prices, local grid load, and expected renewable electricity production. An optimal heating strategy is then determined on-site based on the expected demand and the pseudo cost function. The expected demand is found via a nearest-neighbor data-mining algorithm using historic data. The optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with long-term simulations assuming different user behavior patterns and optimization strategies. The current approach compares favorably with conventional night tariff-switched operation. Assuming typical user behavior and using real spot market electricity prices as the pseudo cost function leads to cost savings of approximately 12{\%} and energy savings of approximately 4{\%}. Higher energy savings of approximately 12{\%} can be attained by setting the pseudo cost function constant resulting in energy-driven optimization.},

A hot energy demand prediction method is necessary for the EMS to provide the best possible performance. A prediction method using a bottom-up approach based on end-use analysis with detailed energy consumption measurement was developed. One of the advantages of the proposed prediction method is that it provides good accuracy without needing large computational resources. Since the method is based on end-use analysis, the EMS can revise the prediction and controls when necessary. The performance of the developed prediction method was evaluated by comparing it with results produced by support vector regression. An operational simulation was performed to evaluate performance in a more practical environment. The simulation indicated that the proposed method showed the best performance.},

We model it to understand and forecast the daily needs of inhabitants. Thus, the forecasts can be integrated in a control strategy to optimize the energy cost by heating only the necessary DHW volume. At first, we realize a data analysis from real uses of several dwellings to lay assumptions of the statistical model. This study highlights a weekly periodicity, random fluctuations and the different profiles of consumption following the residence, the season, and the day of the week. Otherwise, having no prior information like the location or the number of residents, we propose an adaptive time series model which does not require strong a priori and computational time. Then, we develop an ARMA model to forecast the daily DHW volume and we apply it on each individual installation. This model allows to take into account the periodicity of one week, the consumption of the previous days and random fluctuations. The results obtained on real data show that this approach is very promising.},

abstract = {In this paper, a simulation model that forecasts electricity load profiles for a population of Swedish households living in detached houses is presented. The model is constructed of three separate modules, namely appliance usage, Domestic Hot Water (DHW) consumption and space heating. The appliance and DHW modules are based on non-homogenous Markov chains, where household members move between different states with certain probabilities over the days. The behavior of individuals is linked to various energy demanding activities at home. The space heating module is built on thermodynamical aspects of the buildings, weather dynamics, and the heat loss output from the aforementioned modules. Subsequently, a use case for a neighborhood of detached houses in Sweden is simulated using a Monte Carlo approach. For the use case, a number of justified assumptions and parameter estimations are made. The simulations results for the Swedish use case show that the model can produce realistic power demand profiles. The simulated profile coincides especially well with the measured consumption during the summer time, which confirms that the appliance and DHW modules are reliable. The deviations increase for some periods in the winter period due to, e.g. unforeseen end-user behavior during occasions of extreme electricity prices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Direct load control (DLC) in cooperative game is proposed in this paper. A cooperative game union comprised of some users and a retailer is established to minimize the union costs. The union provides an opportunity to access the balance market indirectly for residents and to reduce risks and costs for the retailer. In addition, Shapley value which embodies the fairness is used in union profits allocation. The method that avoids bidding for residential users simplifies the thresholds of residents to participate in market. Furthermore, the DLC union contributes to imbalance self-management for the retailer, which helps him avoid paying for the regulation cost involved in the deviation between the total quantity bought at markets and the actual consumption. The achievement of union's goal respects the constraints set by users. The method that alleviates the disturbance of DLC to residents meets the dual goals of being both fully responsive and non-disruptive.},

abstract = {In the context of the liberalized and deregulated electricity markets, price forecasting has become increasingly important for energy company's plans and market strategies. Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
