# Preliminary data analysis {#prelimDA}

This chapter presents the results from the preliminary data analysis that was carried out before starting to build forecasting models.
A brief summary of the data is provided along with key visualisations regarding patterns of hot water use.
Next, the results of the data analysis techniques introduced in Section \@ref(TSoverview) are presented.
These results are discussed briefly in terms of their implications for the models presented in Section \@ref(results).

## Data summary

```{r means1, echo=FALSE}
meansDT <- readr::read_csv(paste0(dFolder, "meansDT.csv"))
```

Table 4.1 shows the mean values of hot water electricity demand and other appliance electricity demand for sample households. Mean demand varies significantly for each household, ranging from `r signif(min(meansDT$HWelec), 3)`W (household ``r meansDT$linkID[meansDT$HWelec == min(meansDT$HWelec)]``) to `r signif(max(meansDT$HWelec), 3)`W (household ``r meansDT$linkID[meansDT$HWelec == max(meansDT$HWelec)]``). 
The mean value of hot water demand over all households (mean of means) is `r signif(mean(meansDT$HWelec), 3)`W.



```{r summary1, echo=FALSE}
meansDT %>%
  pander::pander(caption = "Mean values of electricity demand for hot water and other appliances for sample households at half-hourly resolution, rounded to the nearest Watt", 
               col.names = c("Household", "Hot water (W)", "Other appliances (W)"), 
               digits = 0)
```



```{r median1, echo=FALSE}
medianDT <- readr::read_csv(paste0(dFolder, "medianDT.csv"))
```

Table 4.2 shows the median values of hot water electricity demand and other appliance electricity demand for sample households. Median values for hot water electricity demand equal zero for most households, however some display non-zero medians. These non-zero median values may indicate very frequent hot water usage or lack of insulation around the cylinder.


```{r summary2, echo=FALSE}
medianDT %>%
  pander::pander(caption = "Median values of electricity demand for hot water and other appliances for sample households at half-hourly resolution, rounded to the nearest Watt", 
               col.names = c("Household", "Hot water (W)", "Other appliances (W)"), 
               digits = 0)
```

Variation in hot water electricity demand can also be seen in the box and whisker plot shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:demandBoxplot). 
The left and right hand sides of the boxes within Fig. \@ref(fig:demandBoxplot) correspond to the first and third quartiles respectively. The bold vertical line corresponds to the second quartile. The right hand side 'whiskers' extend to 1.5 $\times$ IQR from the third quartile (where 'IQR' is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The mean is included in red. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are considered "outliers" and are plotted individually [@R-ggplot2].
Due to the large number of zero values within the data, the inter-quartile range within each household is highly restricted with respect to the total range.
Points to the right hand side of each whisker (which are numerous enough to appear as a bold line) would normally be considered outliers by this analysis method.
However, it is important that the models constructed in this thesis are able to predict these values, as they indicate times where the element is reheating the water after a significant usage event.
This plot also gives an indication as to the maximum power output for each household.
Assuming there was at least one instance during the year where the element was on for a full half hour, the far right hand side point of each household should correspond approximately with its maximum power output.
Examination of Fig. \@ref(fig:demandBoxplot) indicates that most households have an approximate maximum power output of either 2 kW or 3 kW.

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "averages/boxplot.pdf"))
```

Fig. \@ref(fig:averagePlot) shows the daily hot water electricity demand profile for each household, given by the mean electricity demand over each half hour of the day. It can be seen that these demand profiles vary significantly between households, although many show two distinct peaks, generally during times of day where the grid as a whole experiences peaks. This demonstrates daily patterns of hot water use such as regularly showering in the morning or evening.

## Autocovariance {#ACVresults}

```{r autocovariance, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Autocovariance of hot water electricity demand for sample households over a 10 day lag"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "acfAllHouses.pdf"))
```

Fig. \@ref(fig:autocovariance) shows the autocovariance \@ref(eq:ACV) of our sample households. The peaks at specific lag times show that the households in our sample display strong seasonality, with all households displaying significant peaks in demand occurring on daily intervals, and some households displaying smaller peaks at 12 hour intervals. Some households also display a weekly cycle, which can be seen by the relative increase in the peaks at the seventh day lag. 

## Fourier analysis {#Fourierresults}

Using Fourier analysis methods introduced in Section \@ref(Fouriermeth), the three most significant frequencies (corresponding to three individual seasonalities) were determined from the data.
Most households had large Fourier frequencies at approximately daily or 12 hourly periods, which align with the autocovariance findings. 
The three most significant frequencies did not include a weekly period for any of the households.
This was contrary to expectations based on existing literature [@Gelazanskas2015] and visual inspection of the autocovariance in Fig. \@ref(fig:autocovariance). 
For two households, very long frequencies (49 weeks and 132 weeks) were returned as the most significant. 
Four other households also showed frequencies of greater than one year as the third most significant.

<!--
It is unlikely that adding frequencies of this length would greatly improve the accuracy of a forecasting model, and could lead to very lengthy computation times.
For this reason, caution must be taken when using frequencies obtained by this method in models.

For a list of the three most significant frequencies for sample households as determined by Fourier analysis, refer to Table \@ref(tab:frequencyAnalysis) in the Appendix.

## Stationarity {#statres}

A stationary time series does not have expected values or variances that change when applied to different sequential subsets of the data, as described in Section \@ref(Statmeth).
As ARMA models (see Section \@ref(ARIMAmethodology)) are more accurate when applied to a stationary time series, hot water electricity demand of each household was tested for stationarity.
All of our sample households (except `rf_40`) were determined to be non-stationary.
Thus, when constructing ARIMA models (Section \@ref(ARIMAmethodology)), all households except `rf_40` required first-order differencing (see Section \@ref(diff)), as can be seen by the $d$ values in Table \@ref(tab:ARIMAparameters) in the Appendix.
This means that for most households, rather than fitting an ARMA model to the original demand data, it was instead fitted to the change in demand between time steps.
ARIMAX models (see Sections \@ref(ARIMAXmeth) and \@ref(STLARIMAXmeth)) are slightly less likely to require differencing than the standard ARIMA model, as shown by the $d$ values in Tables \@ref(tab:ARIMAXparameters) and \@ref(tab:STLARIMAXparameters) in the Appendix.
This implies that the errors of the linear regression model are more likely to be stationary than the original data.

## Cross-covariance {#CCVres}

Cross-covariance is our method of determining how much hot water electricity demand is correlated with other electricity demand at different time lags (see Section \@ref(CCVmeth)).
If reasonable cross-correlation is found between hot water electricity demand and lagging values of other appliance electricity demand, this relation may be used to predict future values of hot water electricity demand based on current values of other electricity demand.

Fig. \@ref(fig:crossCovariance) shows that hot water electricity use in our data set is positively correlated with other electricity use over small time lags. 
Most households have their maximum cross-covariances occurring at lags of less than half an hour, however correlations at lags of at least half an hour are necessary for half-hour ahead predictions.
Some households appear to have their maximum correlation at half hour or one hour lags, and all others show positive correlation for lags up to one hour.

To further explore the optimal time lags for using other electricity demand as a regressor (see Sections \@ref(SLRmeth), \@ref(ARIMAXmeth), \@ref(STLARIMAXmeth) and \@ref(SVMmeth)), values of the time lag greater than zero at which cross-correlation is highest were obtained.
These were then plotted as a histogram in Fig. \@ref(fig:ccvMaxLagPlot).
This figure indicates that for ten households, hot water electricity has a maximum correlation with non hot water electricity within lags of half an hour, and an additional five household have their maximum value between half an hour and an hour. 
Six households have maximum cross correlation values at lags of greater than one hour.

From these results, we may infer that incorporating the previous two values of other electricity demand into a forecasting model should be sufficient to capture this effect for most households. Models that utilise these results are presented in Sections \@ref(SLRres), \@ref(ARIMAXres), \@ref(STLARIMAXres), and \@ref(SVMres).

## Linear Regression

As an exploratory technique, simple linear regressions were plotted between hot water demand and the demand of other appliances with a half hour time lag (See an example provided in Fig. \@ref(fig:linRegExample)).

```{r linRegExample, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Linear regression between hot water electriciy demand and electricity demand of other appliances with a half hour time lag for household rf_13)"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "rf_13LinearPlot.png"))
```

Small positive correlations were found for all households.

## Implications for model building

This chapter presented results from some key methods used to understand patterns within the time series data.
Sections \@ref(ACVresults) and \@ref(Fourierresults) showed that hot water electricity demand displays daily seasonality.
This suggests that increased accuracy would be attained by forecasting models which can take seasonality into account.
Section \@ref(CCVres) showed that hot water electricity demand correlates with previous values of other appliances' electricity demand.
The maximum correlation between hot water electricity demand and lagged other electricity demand occurs within the first hour for most households. Thus, when incorporating other appliance demand into forecasting models, we use the previous two time steps to best capture this correlation. 
The following chapter displays the results obtained from forecasting models that incorporate these components of the data.
